<p>Collaborative Study (CS) is a scheduling app designed for UH ICS students to plan study sessions together. CS aims for ICS majors to form connections and better one another as students.
Users of this app will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain a public profile page</li>
<li>Find, rate, and form groups with other students</li>
<li>Join and create study sessions through a public calender</li>
</ul>

Each user receives an editable profile page so others may learn more about them.</p>

<p>On this page, users can create a listing of courses under two categories, "Pros" or "Studs". Pros (short for "Professors") are classes students are competent in, while Studs (short for "Students") are classes they might need help in. Courses are color coded to reflect the individual's confidence of understanding of the subject matter; green: well understood, yellow: some gaps in understanding, red: limited knowledge.</p>

<a id="developer-guide" class="anchor" href="#developer-guide" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Developer Guide</h2>

<p>If you would like to make modifications to this app, download Meteor (<a href="https://www.meteor.com/">here</a>) and any IDE of your choice. Personally, our team enjoyed using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>. Please note that you should be comfortable with HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Jquery before working on our code. The tutorials provided on the Meteor website should also help you get used to the platform.</p>

<p>After downloading Meteor, clone <a href="https://github.com/CollaborativeStudy/CS">our repo</a> from GitHub and get working on it. You may run the app locally through the command line by changing to the "app" directory and running "meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json".</p>

<p>When you are finished making changes, send us a pull request and we'll check it out!</p>

<h2>
<a id="who-are-we" class="anchor" href="#who-are-we" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are we?</h2>

<p>We are CollaborativeStudy, a group of Information and Computer Science (ICS) majors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As ICS majors, we know best: the life of a computer science student can be a difficult and lonely one. It isn't unusual to be a lone wolf, studying by yourself. </p>

<p>Our organization came together to end that. Together, we are developing a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!</p>

<a id="our-journey" class="anchor" href="#our-journey" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Journey</h2>

<h2>
<a id="initial-user-study" class="anchor" href="#initial-user-study" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial User Study</h2>

<p>The test subjects were different majors. We wanted to see how other people would react to this app. We had one ICS major, and the rest were engineer majors, a communications major, an accounting major and a dental hygiene major. We separate these people into three group studies. We had them go to our website and use it without too much instruction. As they dive into our app, they provided all the feedback they could offered. </p>

<p>The majority agreed that overall the main features seemed to work okay however there were a few bugs. Sometimes tutorial blocks will not exit and some actions did not do anything. They even offered many suggestions for improvement. However, for a first test try we believe that we showed great features and a lot potential to our first users!</p>
