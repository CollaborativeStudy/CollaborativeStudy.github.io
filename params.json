In our university, CS majors are usually those lone wolves studying by themselves and we want to end that. Our organization came together to create a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!\r\n\r\n## CS\r\nOur app is called Collaborative Study or CS for short. Our app allows uh students to login with their acccounts and create study sessions with people they meet. Each student will get a profile page and is able to edit their bio, they can find other students and create study sessions, and they can keep track of all of their study sessions on one calender! The goal is to find others that can help you get better as a student. \r\n\r\nCheck out our app at http://cs.meteorapp.com/\r\n\r\n## Our Journey\r\n\r\n### First Milestone\r\nOur first goal for this project was to create a runnig mock up. It was hard to figure out how to seperate each milestone at first. We were wondering how far we should reach for the next two weeks. We figured that we do not have to go too far into our feature implementations. So we chose to reach for full mockups of our pages. We had a great skeleton for our mockups since Chad had great pages previously made. The next step was to add more ideas and create designed pages for them!\r\n\r\nAll of us had no problems actually creating the pages but we all ran into some github and meteor issues. A lot of times when one commits their branches the others have troubles running meteor afterwards. The solution was to add a package, or update meteor, or even just uninstall and reinstall. Right now, meteor might be problematic with windows and macs but we find a way to work around it. Another problem was that one of us even forgot to commit changes to a branch and commited straight to the master. Luckily nothing broke at that moment! So far our project is going well, and we learned from these mistakes so our next milestone will have fewer problems.\r\n\r\n## Here are some sample images of what CollaborativeStudy looks like:\r\n\r\n####Public Landing Page\r\n\r\nThis page displays information about Collaborative Study for people who are not signed in.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/landing-page.png\">\r\n\r\n####Create Study Session Page\r\n\r\nStudy sessions can be created by users using the form.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/create-study-session-page.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Study Session Page\r\n\r\nLists all of the upcoming study sessions.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/study-session-page.png\">\r\n\r\n####Profile Page\r\n\r\nUsers can navigate to the profiles of people attending the study sessions to learn more about each other. Courses are color coded to reflect the individual's confidence of understanding of the subject matter (green: well understood, yellow: some gaps in understanding, red: limited knowledge).\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/profile-page.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Review Page\r\n\r\nUsers will be reviewed based on other STUDs\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/review-page.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Messages Page\r\n\r\nGroups and other users can message each other about study sessions.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/messages-page.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Groups Page\r\n\r\nThis groups page will make easy to start a study session by linking or connecting to them.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/groups-page.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####User Home Page\r\n\r\n######My Calendar\r\nMy Calendar displays the upcoming study sessions that the user is scheduled for.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/my-calender-page.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Notifications\r\nNotifications displays any requests or updates.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/notifications-page.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Calendar\r\n\r\nThe Calendar page displays a list of all of the upcoming public study sessions including sessions that the user has not signed up for.\r\n\r\n <img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/calender-page.png\">\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMariah Gaoiran (@mariahgaoiran) <br>\r\nJipeng \"Neal\" Huang (@huang6606521) <br>\r\nChad Morita (@chadmorita) <br>\r\nMary Santabarbara (@marysantabarbara) <br>\r\n",
