In our university, CS majors are usually those lone wolves studying by themselves and we want to end that. Our organization came together to create a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMariah Gaoiran (@mariahgaoiran) <br>\r\nJipeng \"Neal\" Huang (@huang6606521) <br>\r\nChad Morita (@chadmorita) <br>\r\nMary Santabarbara (@marysantabarbara) <br>\r\n\r\n###Here are some sample images of what CollaborativeStudy will look like:\r\n\r\n####Public Landing Page\r\n\r\nThis page displays information about Collaborative Study for people who are not signed in.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/Chad/public-landing.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Login Page\r\n\r\nThis page is used for logging in.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/Chad/login.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Create Study Session Page\r\n\r\nStudy sessions can be created by users using the form.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/Chad/create-study-session-2.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Study Session Page\r\n\r\nLists all of the upcoming study sessions.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/Chad/study-session.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Study Session Details Page\r\n\r\nThis page displays more information about the study session and allows uesrs to join the study session.\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/Chad/study-session-details.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n####Profile Page\r\n\r\nUsers can navigate to the profiles of people attending the study sessions to learn more about each other.
