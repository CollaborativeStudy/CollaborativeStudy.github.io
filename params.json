In out university, CS majors are usually those lone wolves studying by themselves and we want to end that. Our organization came together to create a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMariah Gaoiran (@mariahgaoiran)   \r\nNeal (@huang6606521)  \r\nChad Morita (@chadmorita)    \r\nMary Santabarbara (@marysantabarbara)       \r\n",
