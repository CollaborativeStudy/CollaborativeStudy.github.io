CS aims for ICS majors to form connections and better one another as students.\r\nUsers of this app will be able to:\r\n* Maintain a public profile page\r\n* Find, rate, and form groups with other students\r\n* Join and create study sessions through a public calender\r\n \r\nCheck out our app at http://cs.meteorapp.com/\r\n\r\n## User Guide\r\n\r\n####Public Landing Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/publicLandingPage.png\">\r\nThe first page users see before logging in is an informational page about Collaborative Study. Users will log in under the the \"Account\" dropdown using their UH username and password.\r\n\r\n####Profile Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/profilePage.png\">\r\nEach user receives an editable profile page so others may learn more about them.\r\n\r\nOn this page, users can create a listing of courses under two categories, \"Pros\" or \"Studs\". Pros (short for \"Professors\") are classes students are competent in, while Studs (short for \"Students\") are classes they might need help in. Courses are color coded to reflect the individual's confidence of understanding of the subject matter; green: well understood, yellow: some gaps in understanding, red: limited knowledge.\r\n\r\n####Review Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/reviewPage.png\">\r\nAccessed from the \"Reviews\" button on a profile, the reviews page is a listing of ratings and reviews left by other users about the profile's owner. Any user is welcome to submit reviews for another user, though they are regulated by an administrator after submission.\r\n\r\n#### My Calendar Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/myCalendar.png\">\r\nThe Calendar page is a visual display of all upcoming public study sessions you have joined. Users may click on a day to create a study session for that day, or may click existing study sessions for more details.\r\n\r\n####Groups Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/groupsPage.png\">\r\nWhen users become comfortable working with specific students, they can form a study \"Group\" to quicken the process of making study sessions with them. Users may create new groups or join existing ones through the groups page.\r\n\r\n####Study Session Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/studySessionsPage.png\">\r\nA listing of all the upcoming study session created by users on CS. Study sessions may be searched for by course using the search bar at the top.\r\n\r\n####Study Session Details Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/studySessionDetailsPage.png\">\r\nA more detailed explanation of a study session can be brought up, either through clicking the \"More Info\" button on the Study Session Page or clicking a study session on the calendar.\r\nFrom here, users may join the study session as a Pro (tutor) or Stud (tutee). Students that join as Pros are welcome to add and remove topics that will be taught at that session.\r\n\r\n####Create Study Session Form\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/createStudySessionPage.png\">\r\nClicking on a day in the calendar results in a modal to create a study session on that day. Users will specify the session title, course, topic, start time and end time for their session.\r\n\r\n####Public Calendar Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/calendarPage.png\">\r\nThe public Calendar page is a visual display of all upcoming public study sessions, including sessions that the user has not signed up for. Users may click on a day to create a study session for that day, or may click existing study sessions for more details.\r\n\r\n####Chat Room Page\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui fluid centered image\" src=\"/screenshots/messagesPage.png\">\r\nA chat room for all online users is also available under the \"Chat Room\" tab.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who are we?\r\n We are CollaborativeStudy, a group of Information and Computer Science (ICS) majors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As ICS majors, we know best: the life of a computer science student can be a difficult and lonely one. It isn't unusual to be a lone wolf, studying by yourself. \r\n\r\n Our organization came together to end that. Together, we are developing a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!\r\n\r\n## Our Journey\r\n To view the progress we're making on the app, see our project milestones at http://github.com/CollaborativeStudy/CS/projects\r\n\r\n##Initial User Study\r\n\r\n The test subjects were different majors. We wanted to see how other people would react to this app. We had one ICS major, and the rest were engineer majors, a communications major, an accounting major and a dental hygiene major. We separate these people into three group studies. We had them go to our website and use it without too much instruction. As they dive into our app, they provided all the feedback they could offered. \r\n\r\n The majority agreed that overall the main features seemed to work okay however there were a few bugs. Sometimes tutorial blocks will not exit and some actions did not do anything. They even offered many suggestions for improvement. However, for a first test try we believe that we showed great features and a lot potential to our first users!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nClick our names for our online portolios or check out our githubs!<br>\r\n\r\n[Mariah Gaoiran](https://mariahgaoiran.github.io/) (@mariahgaoiran) <br>\r\n[Jipeng \"Neal\" Huang] (https://huang6606521.github.io/) (@huang6606521) <br>\r\n[Chad Morita](https://chadmorita.github.io/) (@chadmorita) <br>\r\n[Mary Santabarbara](https://marysantabarbara.github.io/) (@marysantabarbara) <br>\r\n\r\n",
