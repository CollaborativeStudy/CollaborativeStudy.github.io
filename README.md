## Who are we?
We are CollaborativeStudy! We are all Information and Computer Science (ICS) majors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In out university, CS majors are usually those lone wolves studying by themselves and we want to end that. Our organization came together to create a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!
