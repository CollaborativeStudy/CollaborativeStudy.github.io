## Who are we?
We are CollaborativeStudy, a group of Information and Computer Science (ICS) majors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In our university, CS majors are usually those lone wolves studying by themselves and we want to end that. Our organization came together to create a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!

## CS
Collaborative Study (CS) is a scheduling app designed for UH ICS students to plan study sessions together. 
Users of this app will be able to:
* Maintain a public profile page
* Find, rate, and form groups with other students
* Join and create study sessions through a public calender
CS aims for ICS majors to  get better as a student.
