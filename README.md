## User Guide

####Public Landing Page

<img class="ui fluid centered image" src="/screenshots/publicLandingPage.png">
The first page users see before logging in is an informational page about Collaborative Study. Users will log in under the the "Account" dropdown using their UH username and password.

####Profile Page

<img class="ui fluid centered image" src="/screenshots/profilePage.png">
Each user receives an editable profile page so others may learn more about them.

On this page, users can create a listing of courses under two categories, "Pros" or "Studs". Pros (short for "Professors") are classes students are competent in, while Studs (short for "Students") are classes they might need help in. Courses are color coded to reflect the individual's confidence of understanding of the subject matter; green: well understood, yellow: some gaps in understanding, red: limited knowledge.

####Review Page

<img class="ui fluid centered image" src="/screenshots/reviewPage.png">
Accessed from the "Reviews" button on a profile, the reviews page is a listing of ratings and reviews left by other users about the profile's owner. Any user is welcome to submit reviews for another user, though they are regulated by an administrator after submission.

#### My Calendar Page

<img class="ui fluid centered image" src="/screenshots/myCalendar.png">
The Calendar page is a visual display of all upcoming public study sessions you have joined. Users may click on a day to create a study session for that day, or may click existing study sessions for more details.

####Groups Page

<img class="ui fluid centered image" src="/screenshots/groupsPage.png">
When users become comfortable working with specific students, they can form a study "Group" to quicken the process of making study sessions with them. Users may create new groups or join existing ones through the groups page.

From here, users may join the study session as a Pro (tutor) or Stud (tutee). Students that join as Pros are welcome to add and remove topics that will be taught at that session.

## Who are we?
 We are CollaborativeStudy, a group of Information and Computer Science (ICS) majors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As ICS majors, we know best: the life of a computer science student can be a difficult and lonely one. It isn't unusual to be a lone wolf, studying by yourself. 
 Our organization came together to end that. Together, we are developing a student app that allows ICS majors to connect and study with other students. Doing this will create a fun and safe environment for students who want to make friends but are too shy or intimidated to do so. I hope you will support us throughout this development!

## Our Journey
 To view the progress we're making on the app, see our project milestones at http://github.com/CollaborativeStudy/CS/projects

##Initial User Study

 The test subjects were different majors. We wanted to see how other people would react to this app. We had one ICS major, and the rest were engineer majors, a communications major, an accounting major and a dental hygiene major. We separate these people into three group studies. We had them go to our website and use it without too much instruction. As they dive into our app, they provided all the feedback they could offered. 
 The majority agreed that overall the main features seemed to work okay however there were a few bugs. Sometimes tutorial blocks will not exit and some actions did not do anything. They even offered many suggestions for improvement. However, for a first test try we believe that we showed great features and a lot potential to our first users!
